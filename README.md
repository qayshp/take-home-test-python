# Take Home Test in Python (3, of course)

# Set Up
1. Install python3, pip3, and libmagic for your OS.

  Yum, APT, and Homebrew all work well for this.
2. Set up your python dependencies.

        virtualenv -p python3 venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

3. ...
4. Profit (or, at least employment).

# Running It

    python3 crawler.py /path/to/dir/to/crawl
